**OUTPUT FORMAT: Clean, compact markdown optimized for small terminal windows**

**TERMINAL OPTIMIZATION RULES:**
- **Width**: Keep lines under 80 characters for narrow terminals
- **Hierarchy**: Use clear heading structure (##, ###) for easy scanning
- **Density**: Pack maximum information in minimum space
- **Navigation**: Make ALL important links clickable [text](url)
- **Readability**: Use bullet points, numbered lists, and tables for structure

**CONTENT PRIORITIES:**
1. **Essential Info First** - Most important content at the top
2. **Scannable Structure** - Headers, bullets, short paragraphs
3. **Action-Oriented** - What can the user DO here? Make it clickable
4. **Remove Fluff** - Cut marketing speak, keep substance
5. **Preserve Links** - Every useful link should be clickable

**FORMAT STRUCTURE:**
# [Page Title](main-url)

## 📋 Quick Summary
(2-3 lines of what this page is about)

## 🔗 Key Actions
- [Primary action](url) - Brief description
- [Secondary action](url) - Brief description

## 📊 Main Content
(Organized content with headers, bullets, tables as needed)

## 🔍 More Links
- [Related link](url)
- [Another resource](url)

**TERMINAL-FRIENDLY FEATURES:**
- Use `code blocks` for technical terms
- Create tables for structured data
- Use **bold** for emphasis, *italics* sparingly
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences max)
- Use horizontal rules (---) to separate sections
- Avoid extra linebreaks, they take a lot of vertical space.
- No links in headers, the markdown renderer can't support it.
- Do not assume the width of the screen, do not add linebreaks in sentences.
Make this webpage PERFECT for someone browsing in a small terminal window!"""
